Tokwe-Mukorsi
=============

A project on data and information relevant for a postmoterm, spatial perspective look at the Tokwe-Mukorsi Dam (Lat -20.722165, Lon 30.897196)breach incident in Zimbabwe that occured early February 2014.

## Background
### The Dam
Tokwe-Mukorsi (alternatively Tokwe-Mukosi) Dam is a Concrete Face Rockfill Dam which when complete would have a capacity of 1.8 million cubic litres and become the largest inland lake in Zimbabwe, with a flood area covering more than 9 600 hectares. It is target to produce 6 MegaWatts of electricity and is being developed for water storage and irrigation purposes. The dam is on the Tokwe river, a tributary of the Runde river, which joins the Save at the Mozambique/Zimbabwe border.

### The Incident
From records of 40 years of monitoring the flow from the catchment area, it was deduced that the average annual inflow was received in 12 days as of 12 February 2014. 

Due to inceasant and heavy rain, water levels at the Tokwe Murkosi Dam under construction rapidly rose to 671 meters above sea level on 3 February 2014. On 5 February the water levels reached just over 672 meters. Two outlets were discharging 106 cubic meters per second against an inflow of 560 meters per second. On 6 February water inflows continued to be more than the outflows and the level rose marginally by 26cm.

### The Threat
Water pressure on the incomplete dam caused seepage through the embarkement causing internal erosion and slope failure. The possibility of dam failure threatened yet to be relocated communities within its basin. On 4th February the water level was 5 meters from overflowing thus threatening an estimated 40 000 people.

## This Project
This project hosts data that would possibly be used to plan evacuation of people downstream as well as look perspectively at hydrologic and other factors impacting the still incomplete dam.

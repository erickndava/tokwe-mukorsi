=============

Data and information repository relevant for a postmoterm, spatial perspective look at the Tokwe-Mukorsi (Tokwe-Mukosi) Dam (Lat -20.722165, Lon 30.897196)breach incident in Zimbabwe at that occured early February 2014.

## Background
### The Dam
Tokwe-Mukorsi (alternatively Tokwe-Mukosi) Dam is a Concrete Face Rockfill Dam which when complete would have a capacity of 1.8 milluion cubic litres and become the largest inland lake in Zimbabwe, with a flood area covering more than 9 600 hectares. It is target to produce 6 MegaWatts of electricity and is being developed for water storage and irrigation purposes. The dam is on the Tokwe river, a tributary of the Runde river, which joins the Save at the Mozambique/Zimbabwe border.

### The Incident
Due to inceasant and heavy rain water levels at the Tokwe Murkosi Dam currently under construction rapidly rose to 671 meters above sea level on 3 February 2014. On 5 February the water levels reached just over 672 meters. Two outlets were discharging 106 cubic meters per second against an inflow of 560 meters per second. The contractor considered opening another new outlet to increase outflow and this would take 4 days to complete. On 6 February water inflows continued to be more than the outflows and the level rose marginally by 26cm. Work on the outlet continued and would be complete in 3 days.
